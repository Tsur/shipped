# Shipped

A 2D HTML5 Puzzle based Game made with love for my nephews. Try it out the [web](http://tsur.github.io/shipped) version or download the [desktop](https://github.com/Tsur/shipped/releases) based version app.

# How to play

Get yourself, the red box, shipped out of the matrix :wink: !!

Pieces can only move left/right if it's a horizontal piece or up/down if it's a vertical piece. You gain the game when the red horizontal box get's moved into the far right side. Make all other pieces to let it go!

# How to build it from sources

Make sure your local setup includes [git](https://github.com/git/git) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), then clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/Tsur/shipped.git`, and build it by running `npm run build` on your favorite terminal session. Finally, to play it, start an static web server on the root project path as `http-server` or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]`
